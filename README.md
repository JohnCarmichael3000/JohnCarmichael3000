### Hi there 👋 I'm John Carmichael
> Cloud Developer
<br />
<div>
<p>
I'm an experienced developer with a track record of successfully launched projects. I’m currently working on all things Cloud, development and automation/scripting with C#, PowerShell, Python, SQL, DevOps, Azure, etc.

🚀 One thing I'm focusing on is Microservices/Serverless/Functions. I'm most familiar with Azure, but also AWS Lambdas. I’ve experienced server drift in the past, now I firmly believe serverless is the way forward.

😃 Fun fact about me: I’ve run 10 marathons!

👍 Great Quote I like: From an October 2020 Youtube video with Bill Gates and Stephen Curry. Bill is posed with a hypothetical junior job interview question, "Why should we hire you?". Bill's response: "I like to be on a team. I like thinking through how we can anticipate the future, software is cool." Of course he could have given a long and complicated response, but his answer is just good software development in a nutshell, imho.
