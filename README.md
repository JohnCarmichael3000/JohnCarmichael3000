### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John Carmichael
> Cloud Developer

<div>
<p>
  John Carmichael is an experienced developer with a long track record of successful projects.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on all things Cloud, development and automation/scripting with PowerShell.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Functions (most familiar: Azure, but also AWS Lambda/GCP), Python. 
     Suffered from a bunch of server drift in the past, now I firmly believe serverless is the future.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve run 10 marathons and been on some tech projects that felt like marathons!
